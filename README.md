# Business Landing Website Project - README

## Project Overview

This project involved building a responsive business landing website from scratch using HTML and CSS. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in web development fundamentals, including:

* Creating a structured HTML layout.
* Applying custom CSS styling for visual design.
* Implementing responsive design principles.
* Organizing code for maintainability.

The website consists of a home page and a secondary page with a form, adhering to the project's requirements for functionality and design.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:
* `index.html`: The main landing page of the website.
* `pages/contact.html`: The secondary page containing the form.
* `css/styles.css`: Contains global CSS styles applied across all pages.
* `css/index.css`: Contains CSS styles specific to the home page.
* `css/contact.css`: Contains CSS styles specific to the contact page.
* `images/`: Contains all image assets used in the website.

## Key Features

* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes using media queries.
* **Custom Layout and Styling:** The website features a custom layout and styling using HTML and CSS, including custom typography and color schemes.
* **Navigation:** A navigation bar is implemented to allow users to navigate between the home page and the contact page.
* **Semantic HTML:** HTML5 semantic elements are used to provide structure and meaning to the content.
* **Form Implementation:** The contact page includes a form with input fields and a submit button.
* **Flexbox and Grid:** CSS Flexbox and Grid are used for layout and component design.
* **Code Organization:** CSS styles are organized into separate files for global and page-specific styles.
* **Image handling:** All images include descriptive alt text.

## Technologies Used

    * Custom typography and color schemes are implemented using hex color values.
    * Flexbox and Grid are used for layout and component design.
    * Media queries are used to create responsive breakpoints for different screen sizes.
* **Responsiveness:**

## How to Run

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3.  Navigate to the `pages/contact.html` file to view the contact page.

## Validation

* HTML code has been validated using the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/).

## Best Practices

* Semantic HTML5 is used for proper structure and accessibility.
* CSS is organized into separate files for maintainability.
* Responsive design is implemented using media queries.
* Code is formatted for readability and consistency.
* No inline or embedded styles have been used.

## Future Improvements

* Add JavaScript for interactive elements.
* Implement form validation and error handling.
* Optimize images for better performance.
* Add more pages and content to the website.
* Add more complex responsive design features.
* Improve accessibility.
